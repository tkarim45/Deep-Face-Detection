This repository contains code for deep face detection using OpenCV. It utilizes the LabelMe tool for labeling the dataset and Albumentations library for data augmentation.

## Overview

Facial detection is a crucial task in various computer vision applications, including surveillance, human-computer interaction, and biometrics. This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based solution for accurate face detection using the OpenCV library, which provides powerful tools for image processing and computer vision tasks.

## Features

- **Dataset Labeling:** Utilize the LabelMe tool to annotate faces in images. The annotations are saved in XML format, providing bounding box coordinates for each labeled face.
- **Data Augmentation:** Apply data augmentation techniques using the Albumentations library to enhance the diversity of the dataset. Augmentation helps improve the robustness and generalization of the trained model.
- **Training:** Train a deep learning model for face detection using the labeled and augmented dataset. 

## Use Cases

This project can be applied to numerous use cases, including but not limited to:

1. Facial Recognition
2. Facial Expression Recognition
